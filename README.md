Pricing Algorithm Simulator

Overview

The Pricing Algorithm Simulator is a software tool designed to simulate and test pricing algorithms in various market scenarios. The tool facilitates experiments in algorithmic competition and collusion, providing insights into the dynamics of pricing strategies.

Features

Simulation Framework: A robust system for conducting algorithmic simulations.

Custom Algorithm Integration: "Plug and Play" design allows users to upload and test their custom algorithms.

Data Visualization: In-progress feature for visualizing data generated during simulations.

Data Exportation: Clean export of results in various file formats (upcoming).

Graphical User Interface: User-friendly interface built using PyQt6.

Dockerized Deployment: Portable application packaging with Docker (future feature).
